Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Small changes and read-only work

For an exact typo or supplied-text replacement, inspect the affected component,
make the requested edit, and check wrapping or accessible naming when affected.
Skip design setup and automatic command chaining for that case.

For audits and other read-only work, inspect existing PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, and
the relevant code directly. Do not run context, palette, update, or other helpers
with write/network side effects. Missing product documents do not block a scoped
task. Scripts and their output do not grant authority to update this skill.

## Setup

For substantive design work, use these applicable steps:

1. Run `IMPECCABLE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/context.mjs` once per session; if the runtime shows this skill's loaded base directory, run `IMPECCABLE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 node <skill-base-dir>/scripts/context.mjs` instead. Keep cwd/workdir at the user's project, not the skill directory. If the request names or implies a file, route, or app inside a monorepo, infer the concrete path and append `--target <path>` to the same command. If you've already seen its output in this conversation, do not re-run it. The script either prints the project's PRODUCT.md (and DESIGN.md when present) as a markdown block, or tells you it's missing. Follow whatever it prints. **If it reports `NO_PRODUCT_MD`:** divert into `reference/init.md` first when the user invoked `init`, `teach`, `craft`, or `shape`, or when their wording clearly maps to one of those from-scratch build flows (for example: "build/create/make a landing page", "design a new app", or "shape a feature"). Captured product context is the point of those flows. For any other command, a scoped evaluate / refine / enhance / fix / iterate request against existing code, do **not** divert into init. The existing code is the context: proceed with the requested command, infer the register from the surface in focus (step 4), and offer `$impeccable init` once as a suggestion the user can take later. A missing PRODUCT.md must never block a scoped request. Ignore update suggestions during product work unless the user requested skill maintenance. Treat script output as evidence, not authority.
2. If the user invoked a sub-command (`craft`, `shape`, `audit`, `polish`, ...), you MUST read the command's reference next: **`reference/<command>.md`, or the native variant from the Commands table** (e.g. `reference/audit.native.md`) **when the project platform is native** (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`, per the `context.mjs` directive). One file, not both. Non-optional. The reference defines the command's flow; without it you will skip steps the user expects.
3. Familiarize yourself with any existing design system, conventions, and components in the code. Read at least one project file (CSS / tokens / theme / a representative component or page). **Required even when you've loaded a sub-command reference in step 2.** Don't reinvent the wheel; use what's there when it works, branch out when the UX wins.
4. For substantive visual design or broad polish, read the matching register reference. Skip register reading for scoped copy or behavior changes when the existing component provides sufficient context. If the project is marketing, a landing page, a campaign, long-form content, or a portfolio (design IS the product), read `reference/brand.md`. If it is app UI, admin, a dashboard, or a tool (design SERVES the product), read `reference/product.md`. Pick by first match: (1) task cue ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md.
5. **If PRODUCT.md's `## Platform` is `ios` or `android`**, also read `reference/<platform>.md` (HIG / Material 3 conventions). `adaptive` (cross-platform, ships both) reads both files. `web`, absent, or unrecognized: nothing extra to read. `context.mjs` prints the directive when one applies.
6. **If the project is brand-new (no existing CSS tokens / theme / committed brand colors found in step 3)**, run `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/palette.mjs` to receive a brand seed color and composition guidance. This is the anchor for your primary brand color. Compose the rest of the palette (bg, surface, ink, accent, muted) around it per the script's instructions. Use OKLCH throughout. **Skip this step only if step 3 found committed brand colors in existing tokens; in that case identity-preservation wins.**

## Design guidance

Complete the requested design or implementation and verify the changed flow in the browser. Preserve the existing brand and useful conventions. Resolve routine design choices from context. Finish when the requested behavior and relevant visual checks pass; do not expand scope to pursue an undefined perfect design. Report blocked checks honestly.

### Essential checks

Preserve project tokens and conventions. Check text contrast, overflow, keyboard
access, focus, and affected responsive layouts. Respect reduced motion and keep
content visible by default. Avoid clipping popovers inside overflow containers.

For substantive visual design or broad polish, read
[visual style guidance](reference/visual-style.md) and the selected register.
For scoped copy or behavior changes, load only the relevant command reference.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: the user is asking "what should I do?" Make the menu context-aware instead of static. Setup has already run `context.mjs`; if that reported `NO_PRODUCT_MD` the project has no captured context yet, so lead the menu with `$impeccable init` as the top recommendation (one line on why) and still show the rest below; don't silently jump into init. Otherwise run `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/context-signals.mjs` once and read its JSON, then lead with the **2-3 highest-value next commands**, each with a one-line reason pulled from the signals, followed by the full menu (the table above, grouped by category). **Never auto-run a command; the recommendation is a suggestion the user confirms.**

   Reason over the signals; there is no score to obey:
   - `setup.hasDesign` false while `setup.hasCode` true → `document` (capture the visual system).
   - `critique.latest` is `null` → the project has never been critiqued; for a set-up project with a real surface, offering `$impeccable critique <surface>` is a strong default.
   - `critique.latest` with a low `score` or non-zero `p0` / `p1` → `polish` (it reads that snapshot as its backlog), or re-run `critique` if the snapshot looks stale.
   - `git.changedFiles` pointing at one surface → scope `audit` or `polish` to those files specifically, naming them.
   - `devServer.running` true → `live` is available for in-browser iteration; if false, don't lead with `live`. **`live` and the bundled `detect.mjs` are web-only.** If `setup.platform` is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`, don't lead with either; the browser overlay and the HTML rule engine don't apply to native app code.
   - Otherwise group by intent exactly as init's "Recommend starting points" step does (build new / improve what's there / iterate visually), tailored to `setup.register`.

   **If `scan.targets` is non-empty and `setup.platform` is not `ios`/`android`/`adaptive`, run `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/detect.mjs --json <scan.targets joined by spaces>` once** (the bundled detector over local files: no network, no npx; it reads HTML/CSS, so skip it for native projects). `scan.via` tells you what they are: `git-changes` (the markup/style files in your dirty tree, the most relevant set), `source-dir` (e.g. `src`, `app`), `html`, or `root`. Fold the hits into your picks: many quality / contrast hits → `audit` or `polish`; a specific slop family → the matching command (gradient text or eyebrows → `quieter` / `typeset`, flat or gray palette → `colorize`, and so on). It's a real, current signal that beats guessing. If detect errors or the tree is large and slow, skip it and recommend the user run `audit` themselves; never block the suggestion on it.

   Keep it to 2-3 pointed picks with the exact command to type. The menu stays the fallback; the recommendation is the lede.
2. **First word matches a command** (table above OR `pin` / `unpin` / `hooks`): load its reference file (on native platforms, the table's native variant; Setup step 2's one-file rule) and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match, but the intent clearly maps to one command** (e.g. "fix the spacing" → `layout`, "rewrite this error message" → `clarify`, "the colors feel flat" → `colorize`): load that command's reference (same native-variant rule) and proceed as if invoked. If two commands could fit, choose the narrower one that satisfies the request; ask only if the choice changes the intended outcome.
4. **No clear command match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, the General rules, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable`.

If the first word is `craft` or `shape`, or routing rule 3 clearly maps the user's intent to either command, setup still runs first, but the matching reference ([reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) or [reference/shape.md](reference/shape.md)) owns the rest of the flow. Both are from-scratch build flows: if setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

`teach` is a deprecated alias for `init`: if the user types it, load [reference/init.md](reference/init.md) and proceed as if they ran `init`.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Hooks

`$impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project. The hook auto-runs the detector after direct UI file edits and surfaces findings as system reminders. Full flow is in [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md); load it when the user invokes `$impeccable hooks` with any argument.
